> [!Note]
> This repository is meant for beginners who are completely new to computer science.

> [!Warning]
> This repository may contain some inaccuracies due to simiplification of concepts. Please use this along with other resources instead of relying on it completely; this guide is not going to have the answers to every question you have, and part of computer science is learning how to problem solve on your own.

## How to Use
When you click on a file or folder listed on this page, you will see multiple lessons in the form a file tree. You can see them [here](https://github.com/sbrothers7/JSLessons/tree/main/00SetupDevEnv)

Each lesson will be in a seperate folder containing a README file containing the lesson and sometimes code files that are exercises for you to complete. There will be more instructions on how to use the exercise files in the [first lesson](https://github.com/sbrothers7/JSLessons/blob/main/00SetupDevEnv/README.md).
