# Lesson 00 - Setting Up a Development Environment
### In this lesson, you will:
- Learn what a development enviroment is
- Set up your own development environment for Javascript
- Learn about some prerequisite computer science knowledge

## 01 What Is a Development Environment?
A development environment is a set of software tools for developers to build, test, and <ins>debug</ins> their software. An integrated development environment (IDE) is software (typically a <ins>GUI</ins> application) that helps create and manage dev envs that contain (almost always) a <ins>source code editor</ins>, <ins>build</ins> automation tools, and a <ins>debugger</ins> at the least. Some IDEs are specialized for a certain language.

### Definitions
**Debug:** A "bug" in programming refers to errors (typically). Therefore to de-bug something, one must get rid of the bugs. We will go over the different types of errors and how to interpret them in the next section.

**GUI:** An acronym for Graphical User Interface. A user interface (UI) is any sort of medium that allows a user to manipulate a program. Using the mouse to click on elements (like buttons) on a screen is a key characteristic of GUI based programs. Typically, GUI programs are easier to use for the average person compared to older methods like CLI (Command Line Interface). MSDOS is an example of a collection of CLI software. 

**Source code:** Source code is the term used for what we often refer to as "code". It is human readable text that contains the instructions for a software.

**Build:** Building in computer science refers to transforming the source code into executable software (namely applications). 

## 02 Setting Up Your Dev Env
There are a variety of IDEs out there that are capable of establishing a dev env for Javascript. For convenience, this guide will assume that you will be using Visual Studio Code as your IDE. If you do not want Microsoft's built-in <ins>telemetry</ins>/tracking, VSCodium is the <ins>free</ins> (libre) version. 

### Definitions
**Telemetry:** Telemetry is the automated process of collecting data for analysis or monitoring. 

**Free (software):** Free software *is* free in terms of cost, but it is also software that is open source (meaning the source code is available to the public), and can be freely modified and redistributed. You can learn more about free software [here]()
